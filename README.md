# AI Experimentation Playground

Welcome to my AI experimentation playground! This repository contains various experiments and implementations focused on advancing AI techniques. Each directory represents a different exploration area with its own focus and implementation details.

## Projects

### 1. dumb2intel
Enhancing smaller language models with advanced reasoning capabilities through reflection and reaction techniques. This experiment focuses on making "dumb" models appear more intelligent by implementing various cognitive architectures.

### 2. memGPT
An implementation of memory management for AI systems using three distinct databases for different memory types. This explores how AI can better manage and retrieve information over extended interactions.

### 3. cybertron
A cybersecurity-focused experiment leveraging multi-agent systems for penetration testing and vulnerability detection. This will implement various security testing methodologies using AI agents.
